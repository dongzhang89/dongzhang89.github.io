I am a Research Assistant Professor at the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), where I work closely with <a href="https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/tim-kwang-ting-cheng">Prof. Kwang-Ting Cheng</a>. I also collaborate closely with AI Chip Center for Emerging Smart Systems (ACCESS) as a Faculty Researcher (member of the professor team). Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of CSE of HKUST from Jan. 2022 to Nov. 2023. Before joining HKUST, I earned my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, where I was supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ByBLlEwAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Jinhui Tang</a>. From Sep. 2018 to Sep. 2020, I was supported by the China Scholarship Council as a joint Ph.D. student at NTU in Singapore, under the supervision of Prof. Hanwang Zhang and Prof. Qianru Sun.
