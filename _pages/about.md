Currently, I serve as a Professor at Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST). Prior to this appointment, I was a Research Assistant Professor at the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) from Dec. 2023 to Nov. 2025, where I worked closely with <a href="https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/tim-kwang-ting-cheng">Prof. Kwang-Ting Cheng</a>. Concurrently, I collaborated closely with AI Chip Center for Emerging Smart Systems (ACCESS) as a Faculty Researcher (member of the professor team). Before joining HKUST faculty, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at HKUST's Department of CSE from Jan. 2022 to Nov. 2023. I earned my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology from NJUST under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ByBLlEwAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Jinhui Tang</a>. From Sep. 2018 to Sep. 2020, I was sponsored by the China Scholarship Council as a joint Ph.D. student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, where I was jointly supervised by Prof. Hanwang Zhang and Prof. Qianru Sun.
